        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Put pasta water on to boil:</h4>
                <p>
                    Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 
                    2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Brown the ground beef:</h4>
                <p>
                    In a large skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. 
                    Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.
                    Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. 
                    Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef:</h4>
                <p>
                    Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet.
                    Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent 
                    and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
                    Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, 
                    reduce the heat to low, and cook for another 5 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Make the sauce:</h4>
                <p>
                    Transfer the beef mixture to a medium-sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. 
                    Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.
                    Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts 
                    to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
                    Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, 
                    a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition.
                    Add salt to taste. Remember that you will later be adding parmesan, 
                    which is salty.
                    Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain 
                    a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. 
                    Scrape the bottom of the pot occasionally, making sure nothing 
                    sticks to the bottom and scorches.
                    Remove from heat.
